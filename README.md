DISCLAIMER | This file is for educational and testing purposes only.

Python script for ARP spoofing, ARP spoofing is a malicious attack in which the hacker sends spoofed ARP on a network. Each node in a connected network has an ARP table through which we identify the IP address and MAC address of connected devices.

This script requires the Scapy library, and WinPcap or Npcap for proper operation.
